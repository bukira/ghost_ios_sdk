        "title": "Down The Rabbit Hole",
        "plaintext": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and\nof having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister\nwas reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use\nof a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day\nmade her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a\ndaisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,\nwhen suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very\nmuch out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall\nbe late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she\nought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and\nlooked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed\nacross her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a\nwaistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she\nran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the\nworld she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped\nsuddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping\nherself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of\ntime as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen\nnext. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it\nwas too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there\nshe saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the\nshelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of\nkilling somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell\npast it.\n\n'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think\nnothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I\nwouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which\nwas very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles\nI've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the\ncentre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I\nthink—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for\nshowing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was\ngood practice to say it over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I\nwonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude\nwas, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!\nHow funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads\ndownward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad there was no one\nlistening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '—but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is\nthis New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy\ncurtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?)\n'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking\nagain. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the\ncat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I\nwish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat\nbats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying\nto herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and\nsometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was\ndozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\nDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you\never eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she\nlooked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,\nand the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\nmoment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear\nit say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'\nShe was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer\nto be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of\nlamps hanging from the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice\nhad been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she\nwalked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;\nthere was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was\nthat it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the\nlocks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not\nopen any of them.\n\nHowever, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not\nnoticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she\ntried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much\nlarger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the\nloveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and\nwander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\nshe could not even get her head though the doorway; 'and even if my head would\ngo through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my\nshoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if\nI only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were\nreally impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the\ntable, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of\nrules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little\nbottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the\nneck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully\nprinted on it in large letters.\n\nIt was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going\nto do that in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's\nmarked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about\nchildren who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\nthings, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had\ntaught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too\nlong; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and\nfinding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart,\ncustard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very\nsoon finished it off.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened\nup at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little\ndoor into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to\nsee if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about\nthis; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out\naltogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried\nto fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for\nshe could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the\ngarden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found\nshe had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for\nit, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly\nthrough the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the\ntable, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying,\nthe poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\n'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather\nsharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself\nvery good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she\nscolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she\nremembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of\ncroquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of\npretending to be two people. 'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to\npretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one\nrespectable person!'\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she\nopened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were\nbeautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it\nmakes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I\ncan creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't\ncare which happens!'\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which way?',\nholding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and\nshe was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure,\nthis generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed\nquite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",
        "html": "<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>\n<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>\n<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>\n<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>\n<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p>\n<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\n<p>'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)</p>\n<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p>\n<p>Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p>\n<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>\n<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.

The natives of the\nBritish Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through\nthe medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to\ntheir families.\n\nThe Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were\nheld in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their\nignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they\nhad yet several years to serve.\n\nAnd so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West\nAfrica, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation\nof the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly\nEuropean power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story,\nfor he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his\ndestination.\n\nClayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the\nnoblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious\nbattlefields--a strong, virile man --mentally, morally, and physically.\n\nIn stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features\nregular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by\nhis years of army training.\n\nPolitical ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the\nColonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and\nimportant commission in the service of the Queen.\n\nWhen he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The\npreferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking\nand intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance\nand responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon.\nAlice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking\nthis fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that\nappalled him.\n\nFor her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it\nso. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.\n\nThere were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express\nvarious opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history\nis silent.\n\nWe know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and\nLady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.\n\nA month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing\nvessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.\n\nAnd here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes\nand from the knowledge of men.\n\nTwo months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a\nhalf dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of\nthem or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was\nfound upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda\nhad gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had\nscarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.\n\nThe Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type\noften seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed\nof the offscourings of the sea--unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race\nand every nation.\n\nThe Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies,\nhating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a\nbrute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two\narguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a revolver--nor is it\nlikely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.\n\nSo it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young\nwife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed\nwere never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.\n\nIt was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what\nwas destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then\nunborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.\n\nTwo sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on\nduty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.\n\nThe men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from\nthe sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind\nthe captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange\nnarrative would never have been recorded.\n\nBut just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and,\nas he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck,\noverturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.\n\nFor an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley\nof awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage,\nthe captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the\ndeck.\n\nThe man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus\naccentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear\nof a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between\nmassive shoulders.\n\nAs he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the\ncaptain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.\n\nFrom scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he\nhad met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he\nwhipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of\nmuscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as\nquick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in\nthe sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm\nas he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.\n\nWords passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he\nwas disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he\ncountenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained\npassengers.\n\nThe captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of\nit, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.\n\nHe did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm\nwielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he\nfeared--England's far-reaching navy.\n\nThe two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded\ncomrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael,\ntried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton\nwith a word of gruff thanks.\n\nThough the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he\nhad scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward\nthe forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further\nconversation.\n\nThey did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them\nmore than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.\n\nThey took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate\noccurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted\nhim to eat at the same time.\n\nThe other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the\nvillainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse\nwith the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left\nvery much to themselves.\n\nThis in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather\nisolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep\nin touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody\ntragedy.",

Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.</p>\n<p>There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.</p>\n<p>We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.</p>\n<p>A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.</p>\n<p>And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.</p>\n<p>Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.</p>\n<p>The Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea--unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.</p>\n<p>The Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them--a belaying pin and a revolver--nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.</p>\n<p>So it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.</p>\n<p>It was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.</p>\n<p>Two sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.</p>\n<p>The men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.</p>\n<p>But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.</p>\n<p>For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.</p>\n<p>The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small--a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.</p>\n<p>As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.</p>\n<p>From scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.</p>\n<p>Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.</p>\n<p>The captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.</p>\n<p>He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared--England's far-reaching navy.</p>\n<p>The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.</p>\n<p>Though the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.</p>\n<p>They did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.</p>\n<p>They took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.</p>\n<p>The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.</p>\n<p>This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.</p>\n",

        "title": "I Have a Dream",
        "plaintext": "I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the\ngreatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today,\nsigned the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great\nbeacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the\nflames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long\nnight of their captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years\nlater, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of\nsegregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro\nlives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material\nprosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the\ncorners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so\nwe've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the\narchitects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and\nthe Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which\nevery American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes,\nblack men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of\n\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" It is obvious today that America\nhas defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are\nconcerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the\nNegro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient\nfunds.\"\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to\nbelieve that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of\nthis nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us\nupon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency\nof Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the\ntranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of\ndemocracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of\nsegregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our\nnation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.\nNow is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This\nsweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there\nis an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not\nan end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off\nsteam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns\nto business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America\nuntil the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will\ncontinue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice\nemerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm\nthreshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our\nrightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to\nsatisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and\nhatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and\ndiscipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical\nviolence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting\nphysical force with soul force.\n\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead\nus to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as\nevidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny\nis tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is\ninextricably bound to our freedom.\n\nWe cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.\n\nWe cannot turn back.\n\nThere are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be\nsatisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the\nunspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as\nour bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels\nof the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as\nthe negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can\nnever be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and\nrobbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\" We cannot be\nsatisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York\nbelieves he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we\nwill not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness\nlike a mighty stream.\"\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and\ntribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of\nyou have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered\nby the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You\nhave been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith\nthat unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to\nAlabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go\nback to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this\nsituation can and will be changed.\n\nLet us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.\n\nAnd so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have\na dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true\nmeaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\ncreated equal.\"\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former\nslaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at\nthe table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering\nwith the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be\ntransformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where\nthey will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their\ncharacter.\n\nI have a dream  today!\n\nI have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its\ngovernor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and\n\"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black\ngirls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as\nsisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream  today!\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and\nmountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked\nplaces will be made straight; \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and\nall flesh shall see it together.\"\n\nThis is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.\n\nWith this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone\nof hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of\nour nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be\nable to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail\ntogether, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one\nday.\n\nAnd this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will\nbe able to sing with new meaning:\n\nMy country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.\nLand where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring!\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.\n\nAnd so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.\n\nLet freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\n\nBut not only that:\n\nLet freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from\nevery village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able\nto speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews\nand Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in\nthe words of the old Negro spiritual:\n\nFree at last! Free at last!\n\nThank God Almighty, we are free at last!",

With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.</p>\n<p>And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.<br>\nLand where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,<br>\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.</p>\n<p>And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.<br>\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.<br>\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.<br>\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But not only that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.<br>\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.<br>\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.<br>\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:</p>\n<p><em>Free at last! Free at last!</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!</em></p>\n",
